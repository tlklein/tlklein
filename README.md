# Howdy, I’m Trinity Klein 

I’m a Cloud Developer with a B.S. in Computer Information Systems (Cum Laude) and AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. I build cloud-native and full-stack systems with a focus on automation, infrastructure as code, and scalable application design. My work spans serverless AWS projects, CI/CD pipelines, and production-style applications that solve real operational problems.

## Featured Projects 

- **[Cloud Resume Challenge](https://github.com/tlklein/portfolio-website)** - A fully serverless, end-to-end web application showcasing cloud-native design and automation. Built on AWS using S3, CloudFront, Lambda, and DynamoDB, deployed via Terraform with GitHub Action CI/CD pipelines. 
- **[Innov8 Barber Shop Management System](https://github.com/tlklein/CIS-4375-Team3-CapstoneProject)** - A full-stack web application built for a local barbershop owner, featuring a public-facing site and a private dashboard to manage clients, services, and appointments.
- **[Enterprise Data Platform](https://github.com/tlklein/mongodb-data-platform-project)** - A full-stack data platform built with Vue 3 and Node.js to manage events, services, and client data. Features role-based access control, interactive data visualizations, and a modular MEVN architecture designed for maintainability and real-world scalability.
- **[IT Asset Management Database](https://github.com/tlklein/oracle-sql-db-project)** - Production-oriented relational database with constraints, automation, cloud migration, and performance tuning.
- **[Multi-Step Cyber Attack Simulation](https://github.com/tlklein/multi-step-cyber-attack)** - Conducted a multi-step attack simulation in a TryHackMe lab environment.
- **[College Apartment Network Design](https://github.com/tlklein/college-apartment-network-design)** - Designed a full network architecture with redundancy, performance optimization, and security considerations.
- **GoGreen Insurance Cloud Architecture (design-only)** - Three-tier AWS architecture for secure, scalable file storage; includes diagrams and proof-of-concept notes.
